base components for my new blog redo

About a year ago i did finally catch up with tech and decided to rewrite my personal web blog, while v3 was built with wordpress, v4 now is based on a more modern stack of technology, featuring https://strapi.io as a cms and for the frontend, i decided to run on as little dependencies as possible. thus i am using the component generation and compilation tool https://stenciljs.com, without any bindings to any other kind of frameworks.

the result has now been running stable for almost a year, upgrades are working like a charm, no upgrade of any software component ever took longer than 2 hours in total, neither the cms nor the stenciljs, stuff never broke, documentation provided by the 3rd party providers are always up to date and easy to follow. proofing that one can build a modern web project with minimal dependencies and a simple migration path.
